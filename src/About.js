   <p><b>Why Choose Us?</b><br/><br/>
We believe in inclusive education. If a few students need extra attention, we are more than happy to extend our services. We fervently believe that no two students are alike, and therefore we need to create opportunities for our students to learn and be assessed in a variety of ways.

<b>Assessment</b><br/>
Assessment is a continuous process of gathering and interpreting evidence to make judgments about student learning. Assessment identifies what students know, understand and can do at 
different stages in the learning process. Assessment helps teachers to plan, guide and implement learning.

<div className='con32'>
<b>Inclusion</b><br/>
Every child is different; they vary in their physiological, psychosocial and cognitive make up. Hence, it is natural that they should react differently to their environment and learn differently. Although it is important to follow
 social norms, it unlikely that anyone can fit into one rigid mould.
